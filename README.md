  > I irregularly angel invest small checks ($2500-$5000) of my own money in early-stage startups I'm excited about. Think of me as an advisor with skin in the game â€” I love helping with tricky, ambiguous problems, providing access to my network and audience, or even just lending an ear to founders building exciting new things.
